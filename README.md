# Free Open Scientific Equipment

Fermium LTD announces the free release of all scientific equipment designs under the terms of the MIT license. You are free to use them as you wish.

## Why?

Our small business is no longer competitive in this sector, and thus we've ceased production of this scientific equipment.

## What's Included

- Microwave Optics Kit:
  - [Microwave RX and TX](https://github.com/Fermium/ltk-mw-electronic): A pair of ultra-low-cost 10GHz microwave transmitters and receivers
  - [Microwave Kit Display](https://github.com/Fermium/frm-mw-display)
  - [Diode Detector](https://github.com/Fermium/frm-mw-diode-detector): A 10GHz diode detector for studying evanescent waves and wave propagation in waveguides
  - [Mechanics](https://github.com/Fermium/ltk-mw-mechanics) including:
    - [Transmitter and Receiver](https://github.com/Fermium/ltk-mw-mechanics/tree/master/transmitter%20and%20receiver) with rear protractor
    - [Structure](https://github.com/Fermium/ltk-mw-mechanics/tree/master/structure) with feet, rulers, center protractor, and center mount
    - [PCB Optics Components](https://github.com/Fermium/ltk-mw-mechanics/tree/master/pcbs): Mirrors, polarizers, photon-sieves, Fresnel zone plates

# frm-mw-diode-detector

ltk-mw-display is an educational DC-coupled VU-meter. The project is 80% complete but has a few electronic bugs and noise issues to address. It takes input from two mono 3.5mm DC-coupled jacks and displays the signals.
